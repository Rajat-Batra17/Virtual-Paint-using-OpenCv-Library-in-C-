# Virtual-Paint-using-OpenCv-Library-in-CPP-


This programme is developed in C++ and makes use of the well-known OpenCV package. OpenCV is a software library for computer vision and machine learning that comprises several popular image analysis techniques that can assist us in developing custom and interesting computer vision applications.                 

Given real-time webcam data, this paint-like C++ application uses the OpenCV library to detect the predefined colours (a sketch cap in this example) and lets the user to draw by moving the item, making drawing basic things both spectacular and exciting.

In this project, I've set the hue, saturation, and value of two colours: orange and red. This was accomplished with the assistance of my colour picker code written in C++ using OpenCv. Other colours can also be defined the same way.

Make sure you're seated in a well-lit environment for accurate colour detection.
